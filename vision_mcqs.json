While about half of the star’s \ndebris continues on its original path, the other half is attracted by the black hole’s gravitational pull. The \ngradual growth of this material bound to the black hole produces a short-lived flare of emission, known \nas a tidal disruption event. \n• \nHence, option (d) is the correct answer."

Thus, this provision makes only \nelementary education a Fundamental Right and not higher or professional education. Hence, option \n(d) is the correct answer. \n• \nThis provision was added by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002. This amendment is a \nmajor milestone in the country’s aim to achieve ‘Education for All’. The government described this step \nas ‘the dawn of the second revolution in the chapter of citizens’ rights’. \n• \nEven before this amendment, the Constitution contained a provision for free and compulsory \neducation for children under Article 45 in Part IV. Hence, option (b) is not correct. \n• \nHowever, being a directive principle, it was not enforceable by the courts. Now, there is scope for \njudicial intervention in this regard.

In this judgement, the Court overruled its earlier judgement (1992) which declared that there was a \nfundamental right to education up to any level including professional education like medicine and \nengineering. \n• \nIn pursuance of Article 21A, the Parliament enacted the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory \nEducation (RTE) Act, 2009.

The Union government deals with the matters of national \nimportance like defence, foreign affairs, currency, communication and so on. The state \ngovernments, on the other hand, look after the matters of regional and local importance like \npublic order, agriculture, health, local government and so on. \no \nWritten Constitution \n▪ \nIt specifies the structure, organisation, powers and functions of both the Central and state \ngovernments and prescribes the limits within which they must operate. Thus, it avoids \nmisunderstandings and disagreements between the two. \no \nDivision of Powers \n▪ \nThe Constitution divided the powers between the Centre and the states in terms of the Union List, \nState List and Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule. \no \nSupremacy of the Constitution \n▪ \nThe Constitution is the supreme (or the highest) law of the land. The laws enacted by the Centre \nand the states must conform to its provisions. \no \nRigid Constitution \n▪ \nThe division of powers established by the Constitution as well as the supremacy of the \nConstitution can be maintained only if the method of its amendment is rigid. Hence, the \nConstitution is rigid to the extent that those provisions which are concerned with the federal \nstructure. \no \nIndependent Judiciary \n▪ \nThe Constitution establishes an independent judiciary headed by the Supreme Court for two \npurposes: one, to protect the supremacy of the Constitution by exercising the power of judicial \nreview; and two, to settle the disputes between the Centre and the states or between the states. \no \nBicameralism \n▪ \nThe Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature consisting of an Upper House (Rajya Sabha) \nand a Lower House (Lok Sabha). The Rajya Sabha represents the states of Indian Federation, \nwhile the Lok Sabha represents the people of India as a whole. \n• \nIntegrated Judiciary is a unitary feature of the Indian constitution. \no \nThe Indian Constitution has established an integrated judicial system with the Supreme Court at the \ntop and the state high courts below it. This single system of courts enforces both the Central laws as \nwell as the state laws. In US, on the other hand, there is a double system of courts whereby the federal \nlaws are enforced by the federal judiciary and the state laws by the state judiciary. \n• \nHence option (c) is the correct answer."

        "explanation": "• \nFirst Past The Post System (FPTP) is a plurality voting method, a plurality meaning the largest part of the \nwhole, in contrast to majority, which generally means more than half of the whole. Under FPTP the \ncandidate with the highest number (but not necessarily a majority) of votes is elected. \n• \nThough the Constitution has adopted the system of proportional representation in the case of Rajya \nSabha, it has not preferred the same system in the case of Lok Sabha. Instead, it has adopted the \nFirst-past-the-post system (territorial representation) for the election of members to the Lok Sabha. \nHence statement 1 is not correct. \n• \nUnder this system, every member of the legislature represents a geographical area known as a \nconstituency. From each constituency, only one representative is elected. Hence such a constituency is \nknown as a single-member constituency. In this system, a candidate who secures majority of votes is \ndeclared elected. There is no need to get 50 percent of the total votes to get elected. Hence statement \n2 is not correct. \no \nThis simple majority system of representation does not represent the whole electorate. In other words, \nit does not secure due representation to minorities (small groups). \n• \nThe system of proportional representation aims at removing the defects of territorial representation. Under \nthis system, all sections of the people get representation in proportion to their number. Even the smallest \nsection of the population gets its due share of representation in the legislature. \no \nThere are two kinds of proportional representation, namely, single transferable vote system and list \nsystem. In India, the first kind is adopted for the election of members to the Rajya Sabha and state \nlegislative council and for electing the President and the Vice-President. \n \n \nFREE BY KING R QUEEN P [ऋषभ राजपूत]\nKING R QUEEN P [Help Others God Will Help You]\n \n27                                                                              www.visionias.in                                                   ©Vision IAS"

In this process, natural gas containing methane (CH4) can \nbe used to produce hydrogen with thermal processes, such as steam-methane reformation and partial \noxidation.

They’re essentially color codes, used within the energy \nindustry to differentiate between the types of hydrogen. Depending on the type of production used, \ndifferent colors are assigned to the hydrogen. \n• \nHydrogen emits only water when burnt. It derives the grey hydrogen name because of the process of \nproduction and not on basis of the by products after burning.
