Constitution can be broadly defined as the basic principles and laws of a nation, state, or social group that 
determine the powers and duties of the government and guarantee certain rights to the people in it. 
• 
Basic functions of a constitution 
o 
Any group will need some basic rules that are publicly promulgated and known to all members of that 
group to achieve a minimal degree of coordination. But these rules must not only be known, they must 
also be enforceable. If citizens have no assurance that others will follow these rules, they will 
themselves have no reason to follow these rules 
▪ 
Thus, It provides a set of basic rules that allow for minimal coordination amongst members 
of a society. 
o 
The constitution specifies who has the power to make decisions in a society. It decides how the 
government will be constituted. 
o 
Constitution also sets some limits on what a government can impose on its citizens. These limits 
are fundamental in the sense that government may never trespass them. 
o 
Constitution also enables the government to fulfil the aspirations of a society and create conditions for 
a just society.

▪ 
All of them are available against the arbitrary action of the state. However, some of them are 
also available against the action of private individuals. Hence, statement 2 is correct. 
▪ 
Some of them are negative in character, that is, place limitations on the authority of the State, 
while others are positive in nature, conferring certain privileges on the persons.  
▪ 
They are justiciable, allowing persons to move the courts for their enforcement, if and when they 
are violated.

They are defended and guaranteed by the Supreme Court. Hence, the aggrieved person can 
directly go to the Supreme Court, not necessarily by way of appeal against the judgment of the 
high courts.  
▪ 
They are not sacrosanct or permanent. The Parliament can curtail or repeal them but only by a 
constitutional amendment act and not by an ordinary act. Moreover, this can be done without 
affecting the ‘basic structure’ of the Constitution.

They can be suspended during the operation of a National Emergency except for the rights 
guaranteed by Articles 20 and 21. Further, the six rights guaranteed by Article 19 can be 
suspended only when an emergency is declared on the grounds of war or external aggression (i.e., 
external emergency) and not on the ground of armed rebellion (i.e., internal emergency).

agencies, and analogous services can be restricted or abrogated by the Parliament (Article 33).  
▪ 
Their application can be restricted while martial law is in force in any area. Martial law means 
‘military rule’ imposed under abnormal circumstances to restore order (Article 34). It is different 
from the imposition of a national emergency.  
▪ 
Most of them are directly enforceable (self-executory) while a few of them can be enforced 
on the basis of a law made for giving effect to them. Such a law can be made only by the 
Parliament and not by state legislatures so that uniformity throughout the country is

layer. The ozone layer sits in the upper atmosphere and reduces the amount of harmful ultraviolet 
radiation that reaches Earth from the sun. Ultraviolet radiation can have detrimental effects on both 
humans and the environment. For instance, inducing skin cancer and cataract distorts plant growth, 
and damages the marine environment.

important landmark in the constitutional and political history of India. 
• 
The features of this Act were as follows 
o 
It made the beginning of the representative institutions by associating Indians with the law-making 
process. It, thus, provided that the Viceroy should nominate some Indians as non-official members 
of his expanded council. In 1862, Lord Canning, the then Viceroy, nominated three Indians to his 
legislative council–the Raja of Benaras, the Maharaja of Patiala and Sir Dinkar Rao. 
o 
It initiated the process of decentralization by restoring the legislative powers to the Bombay and 
Madras Presidencies. 
o 
It also provided for the establishment of new legislative councils for Bengal, North-Western 
Provinces and Punjab, which were established in 1862, 1886 and 1897, respectively. 
o 
It empowered the Viceroy to make rules and orders for the more convenient transaction of business in 
the council. It also gave recognition to the ‘portfolio’ system, introduced by Lord Canning in 
1859. Under this, a member of the Viceroy’s council was made in-charge of one or more departments 
of the Government and was authorised to issue final orders on behalf of the council on matters of his

In the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), the Supreme Court declared the above second provision of 
Article 31C as unconstitutional and invalid on the ground that judicial review is a basic feature of the 
Constitution and hence, cannot be taken away. 
• 
In the Minerva Mills case (1980), the Supreme Court also held that ‘the Indian Constitution is founded 
on the bedrock of the balance between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles. They together 
constitute the core of the commitment to social revolution. They are like two wheels of a chariot, one no 
less than the other. To give absolute primacy to one over the other is to disturb the harmony of the 
Constitution. This harmony and balance between the two is an essential feature of the basic structure of 
the Constitution.

• 
Advantages of the Parliamentary System 
o 
Harmony Between Legislature and Executive 
▪ 
The greatest advantage of the parliamentary system is that it ensures harmonious relationship and 
cooperation between the legislative and executive organs of the government. The executive is a 
part of the legislature and both are interdependent at work. 
o 
Responsible Government 
▪ 
By its very nature, the parliamentary system establishes a responsible government. The ministers 
are responsible to the Parliament for all their acts of omission and commission. The Parliament 
exercises control over the ministers through various devices like question hour, discussions, 
adjournment motion, no confidence motion. 
o 
Ready Alternative Government 
▪ 
In case the ruling party loses its majority, the Head of the State can invite the opposition party to 
form the government. This means an alternative government can be formed without fresh 
elections. Hence, Dr. Jennings says, ‘the leader of the opposition is the alternative prime 
minister’. 
o 
Wide Representation 
▪ 
In a parliamentary system, the executive consists of a group of individuals (i.e., ministers who are 
representatives of the people). Hence, it is possible to provide representation to all sections and 
regions in the government. The prime minister while selecting his ministers can take this factor 
into consideration. 
o 
Prevents Despotism. 
• 
Demerits of the parliamentary system 
o 
Continuity of Policies 
▪ 
The parliamentary system is not conducive to the formulation and implementation of long-term 
policies. This is due to the uncertainty of the tenure of the government. A change in the ruling 
party is usually followed by changes in the policies of the government.

Unstable Government

Equality  
o 
The term ‘equality’ means the absence of special privileges to any section of society and the provision

Each House must pass the bill separately. In case of a disagreement between the two Houses, there is 
no provision for holding a joint sitting of the two Houses for the purpose of deliberation and passage 
of the bill.

"Consider the following statements with
respect to the Right to Equality:",b,"• 
RIGHT TO EQUALITY: 
o 
Equality before Law and Equal Protection of Laws 
▪ 
Article 14 says that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or equal 
protection of the laws within the territory of India. This provision confers rights on all persons 
whether citizens or foreigners. 
▪ 
Moreover, the word ‘person’ includes legal persons, viz, statutory corporations, companies, 
registered societies or any other type of legal person.  
▪ 
The concept of ‘equality before the law’ (negative concept) is of British origin while the concept 
of ‘equal protection of laws’ has been taken from the American Constitution. The first concept 
connotes: 
❖ the absence of any special privileges in favour of any person,  
❖ the equal subjection of all persons to the ordinary law of the land administered by ordinary 
law courts, and  
❖ no person (whether rich or poor, high or low, official or non-official) is above the law.  
▪ 
 The second concept, on the other hand, connotes:  
❖ the equality of treatment under equal circumstances, both in the privileges conferred and 
liabilities imposed by the laws,  
❖ the similar application of the same laws to all persons who are similarly situated, and  
❖ the like should be treated alike without any discrimination.  
▪ 
Thus, the former is a negative concept while the latter is a positive concept. However, both of 
them aim at establishing equality of legal status, opportunity and justice. Hence, statement 1 is 
not correct. 
▪ 
The Supreme Court held that where equals and unequals are treated differently, Article 14 does 
not apply. Hence, statement 2 is correct. 
▪ 
While Article 14 forbids class legislation, it permits the reasonable classification of persons, 
objects, and transactions by the law. But the classification should not be arbitrary, artificial, or 
evasive. Rather, it should be based on an intelligible differential and substantial distinction.",,,,,,,VISION IAS PRELIMS-2024 _TEST- 01-32.PDF
"Which of the following are the unitary
features of Indian Constitution?",d,"• 
Unitary state is a system of political organization in which most or all of the governing power resides in a 
centralized government, in contrast to a federal state. 
• 
Despite being a federation Indian constitution possesses many unitary features such as 
o 
Single Constitution 
▪ 
Usually, in a federation, the states have the right to frame their own Constitution separate from 
that of the Centre. In India, on the contrary, no such power is given to the states. The Constitution 
of India embodies not only the Constitution of the Centre but also those of the states. Both the 
Centre and the states must operate within this single-frame. 
o 
Emergency Provisions 
▪ 
The Constitution stipulates three types of emergencies–national, state and financial. During an 
emergency, the Central government becomes all powerful and the states go into the total control 
of the Centre. It converts the federal structure into a unitary one without a formal amendment of 
the Constitution. This kind of transformation is not found in any other federation. 
o 
All-India Services

Recently, telescopes at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) observed a massive 
black hole devouring a star. The incident was the fifth-closest example of a black hole destroying a star 
and occurred 250 million light-years from the earth, in the centre of another galaxy. 
• 
The astronomical phenomenon of the destruction of a star by a black hole is called a Tidal Disruption 
Event (TDE).  
• 
During a TDE, the tidal force of a black hole disrupts the star in vicinity. While about half of the star’s 
debris continues on its original path, the other half is attracted by the black hole’s gravitational pull. The 
gradual growth of this material bound to the black hole produces a short-lived flare of emission, known 
as a tidal disruption event.

"Articles 358 and 359 of the Indian 
Constitution deal with which of the 
following situations? 
(a) Proclamation of National Emergency 
under Article 352 
(b) Financial emergency under Article 360 
(c) President's rule under Article 356 
(d) President's rule under Article 365",a,"• 
Articles 358 and 359 describe the effect of a National Emergency (Article 352) on Fundamental 
Rights. Article 358 deals with the suspension of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 19, 
while Article 359 deals with the suspension of other Fundamental Rights (except those guaranteed by 
Articles 20 and 21). Hence option (a) is the correct answer. 
• 
The differences between Articles 358 and 359 can be summarised as follows: 
o 
Article 358 is confined to Fundamental Rights under Article 19 only whereas Article 359 
extends to all those Fundamental Rights whose enforcement is suspended by the Presidential 
Order.  
o 
Article 358 automatically suspends the fundamental rights under Article 19 as soon as the emergency 
is declared. On the other hand, Article 359 does not automatically suspend any Fundamental Right. It 
only empowers the president to suspend the enforcement of the specified Fundamental Rights. 
o 
Article 358 operates only in case of External Emergency (that is, when the emergency is declared 
on the grounds of war or external aggression) and not in the case of Internal Emergency (ie, when the 
Emergency is declared on the ground of armed rebellion). Article 359, on the other hand, operates in 
case of both External Emergency as well as Internal Emergencies.  
o 
Article 358 suspends Fundamental Rights under Article 19 for the entire duration of the Emergency 
while Article 359 suspends the enforcement of Fundamental Rights for a period specified by the 
president which may either be the entire duration of the Emergency or a shorter period. 
o 
Article 358 extends to the entire country whereas Article 359 may extend to the entire country 
or a part of it.  
o 
Article 358 suspends Article 19 completely while Article 359 does not empower the suspension of the 
enforcement of Articles 20 and 21. 
o 
Article 358 enables the State to make any law or take any executive action inconsistent with 
Fundamental Rights under Article 19 while Article 359 enables the State to make any law or take any 
executive action inconsistent with those Fundamental Rights whose enforcement is suspended by the 
Presidential Order.

The Act marked a second milestone towards a completely responsible government in India. It was a 
lengthy and detailed document having 321 Sections and 10 Schedules. 
• 
The features of this Act were as follows: 
o 
It provided for the establishment of an All-India Federation consisting of provinces and 
princely states as units. The Act divided the powers between the Centre and units in terms of 
three lists–Federal List (for Centre, with 59 items), Provincial List (for provinces, with 54 items) and 
the Concurrent List (for both, with 36 items). Hence statement 1 is correct. 
▪ 
Residuary powers were given to the Viceroy. However, the federation never came into being as 
the princely states did not join it. 
o 
It abolished dyarchy in the provinces and introduced ‘provincial autonomy’ in its place. The provinces 
were allowed to act as autonomous units of administration in their defined spheres. 
▪ 
Moreover, the Act introduced responsible Governments in provinces, that is, the Governor was 
required to act with the advice of ministers responsible to the provincial legislature. This came 
into effect in 1937 and was discontinued in 1939. 
o 
It provided for the adoption of dyarchy at the Centre. Consequently, the federal subjects were divided 
into reserved subjects and transferred subjects. However, this provision of the Act did not come into 
operation at all. 
o 
It introduced bicameralism in six out of eleven provinces. Thus, the legislatures of Bengal, 
Bombay, Madras, Bihar, Assam and the United Provinces were made bicameral consisting of a 
legislative council (upper house) and a legislative assembly (lower house). However, many 
restrictions were placed on them. Hence statement 2 is not correct. 
o 
It further extended the principle of communal representation by providing separate electorates for 
depressed classes (Scheduled Castes), women and labour (workers). 
o 
It abolished the Council of India, established by the Government of India Act of 1858. The secretary 
of state for India was provided with a team of advisors. 
o 
It extended franchise. About 10 per cent of the total population got the voting right. 
o 
It provided for the establishment of a Reserve Bank of India to control the currency and credit of the 
country. 
o 
It provided for the establishment of not only a Federal Public Service Commission, but also a 
Provincial Public Service Commission and Joint Public Service Commission for two or more 
provinces.

Right to Education:   
• 
Article 21 A declares that the State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age 
of six to fourteen years in such a manner as the State may determine. Thus, this provision makes only 
elementary education a Fundamental Right and not higher or professional education. Hence, option 
(d) is the correct answer. 
• 
This provision was added by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002. This amendment is a 
major milestone in the country’s aim to achieve ‘Education for All’. The government described this step 
as ‘the dawn of the second revolution in the chapter of citizens’ rights’. 
• 
Even before this amendment, the Constitution contained a provision for free and compulsory 
education for children under Article 45 in Part IV. Hence, option (b) is not correct. 
• 
However, being a directive principle, it was not enforceable by the courts. Now, there is scope for 
judicial intervention in this regard. This amendment changed the subject matter of Article 45 in 
directive principles. It now reads–‘The state shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and 
education for all children until they complete the age of six years.’ Hence, option (c) is not correct. 
• 
It also added a new fundamental duty under Article 51A that reads–‘It shall be the duty of every citizen of 
India to provide opportunities for education to his child or ward between the age of six and fourteen 
years’.  
• 
In 1993 itself, the Supreme Court recognised a Fundamental Right to primary education in the right to life 
under Article 21. It held that every child or citizen of this country has a right to free education until he 
completes the age of 14 years.  
• 
Thereafter, his right to education is subject to the limits of the economic capacity and development of the 
state. In this judgement, the Court overruled its earlier judgement (1992) which declared that there was a 
fundamental right to education up to any level including professional education like medicine and 
engineering. 
• 
In pursuance of Article 21A, the Parliament enacted the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory 
Education (RTE) Act, 2009. This Act seeks to provide that every child has a right to be provided 
full time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which 
satisfies certain essential norms and standards. Hence, option (a) is not correct. 
• 
This legislation is anchored in the belief that the values of equality, social justice and democracy and the 
creation of a just and humane society can be achieved only through the provision of inclusive elementary 
education to all.

Federalism is a system of government in which the power is divided between a central authority and 
various constituent units of the country. Usually, a federation has two levels of government. One is the 
government for the entire country that is usually responsible for a few subjects of common national 
interest. 
o 
The others are governments at the level of provinces or states that look after much of the day-to-day 
administering of their state. Both these levels of governments enjoy their power independent of the 
other.

▪ 
Constitution establishes a dual polity consisting the Union at the Centre and the states at the 
periphery. Each is endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the field assigned to them 
respectively by the Constitution. The Union government deals with the matters of national 
importance like defence, foreign affairs, currency, communication and so on. The state 
governments, on the other hand, look after the matters of regional and local importance like 
public order, agriculture, health, local government and so on. 
o 
Written Constitution 
▪ 
It specifies the structure, organisation, powers and functions of both the Central and state 
governments and prescribes the limits within which they must operate. Thus, it avoids 
misunderstandings and disagreements between the two. 
o 
Division of Powers 
▪ 
The Constitution divided the powers between the Centre and the states in terms of the Union List, 
State List and Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule. 
o 
Supremacy of the Constitution 
▪ 
The Constitution is the supreme (or the highest) law of the land. The laws enacted by the Centre 
and the states must conform to its provisions. 
o 
Rigid Constitution 
▪ 
The division of powers established by the Constitution as well as the supremacy of the 
Constitution can be maintained only if the method of its amendment is rigid. Hence, the 
Constitution is rigid to the extent that those provisions which are concerned with the federal 
structure. 
o 
Independent Judiciary 
▪ 
The Constitution establishes an independent judiciary headed by the Supreme Court for two 
purposes: one, to protect the supremacy of the Constitution by exercising the power of judicial 
review; and two, to settle the disputes between the Centre and the states or between the states. 
o 
Bicameralism 
▪ 
The Constitution provides for a bicameral legislature consisting of an Upper House (Rajya Sabha) 
and a Lower House (Lok Sabha). The Rajya Sabha represents the states of Indian Federation, 
while the Lok Sabha represents the people of India as a whole. 
• 
Integrated Judiciary is a unitary feature of the Indian constitution. 
o 
The Indian Constitution has established an integrated judicial system with the Supreme Court at the 
top and the state high courts below it. This single system of courts enforces both the Central laws as 
well as the state laws. In US, on the other hand, there is a double system of courts whereby the federal 
laws are enforced by the federal judiciary and the state laws by the state judiciary.

"In the context of methods of election in 
India, consider the following statements 
regarding the First Past The Post System: 
1. The Indian constitution has prescribed 
the First Past The Post System method 
of election to the Lok Sabha and the 
Rajya Sabha. 
2. In this system the candidate needs to get 
more than 50 percent to get elected. 
Which of the statements given above is/are 
correct? 
(a) 1 only 
(b) 2 only 
(c) Both 1 and 2 
(d) Neither 1 nor 2",d,"• 
First Past The Post System (FPTP) is a plurality voting method, a plurality meaning the largest part of the 
whole, in contrast to majority, which generally means more than half of the whole. Under FPTP the 
candidate with the highest number (but not necessarily a majority) of votes is elected. 
• 
Though the Constitution has adopted the system of proportional representation in the case of Rajya 
Sabha, it has not preferred the same system in the case of Lok Sabha. Instead, it has adopted the 
First-past-the-post system (territorial representation) for the election of members to the Lok Sabha. 
Hence statement 1 is not correct. 
• 
Under this system, every member of the legislature represents a geographical area known as a 
constituency. From each constituency, only one representative is elected. Hence such a constituency is 
known as a single-member constituency. In this system, a candidate who secures majority of votes is 
declared elected. There is no need to get 50 percent of the total votes to get elected. Hence statement 
2 is not correct. 
o 
This simple majority system of representation does not represent the whole electorate. In other words, 
it does not secure due representation to minorities (small groups). 
• 
The system of proportional representation aims at removing the defects of territorial representation. Under 
this system, all sections of the people get representation in proportion to their number. Even the smallest 
section of the population gets its due share of representation in the legislature. 
o 
There are two kinds of proportional representation, namely, single transferable vote system and list 
system. In India, the first kind is adopted for the election of members to the Rajya Sabha and state 
legislative council and for electing the President and the Vice-President.

It was in 1934 that the idea of a Constituent Assembly for India was put forward for the first time 
by M.N. Roy, a pioneer of communist movement in India.  
o 
In 1935, the Indian National Congress (INC), for the first time, officially demanded a Constituent 
Assembly to frame the Constitution of India. 
o 
In 1938, Jawaharlal Nehru, on behalf the INC declared that ‘the Constitution of free India must be 
framed, without outside interference, by a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis of adult 
franchise’. 
• 
The Constituent Assembly was constituted in November 1946 under the scheme formulated by the 
Cabinet Mission Plan.The features of the scheme were: 
o 
The total strength of the Constituent Assembly was to be 389. Of these, 296 seats were to be allotted 
to British India and 93 seats to the princely states. 
o 
Out of 296 seats allotted to British India, 292 members were to be drawn from the eleven governors’ 
provinces and four from the four Chief Commissioners’ provinces, one from each. 
o 
Each province and princely state (or group of states in case of small states) were to be allotted 
seats in proportion to their respective population. Roughly, one seat was to be allotted for every 
million population. Hence statement 1 is correct. 
o 
Seats allocated to each British province were to be divided among the three principal communities–
Muslims, Sikhs and General (all except Muslims and Sikhs), in proportion to their population. 
o 
The representatives of each community were to be elected by members of that community in the 
provincial legislative assembly and voting was to be by the method of proportional representation by 
means of a single transferable vote. 
o 
The representatives of the princely states were to be nominated by the heads of the princely 
states. Hence statement 2 is correct. 
• 
It is, thus, clear that the Constituent Assembly was to be a partly elected and partly nominated 
body. Moreover, the members were to be indirectly elected by the members of the provincial assemblies, 
who themselves were elected on a limited franchise. 
• 
The elections to the Constituent Assembly (for 296 seats allotted to the British Indian Provinces) 
were held in July-August 1946. The Indian National Congress won 208 seats, the Muslim League 73 
seats and the small groups and independents got the remaining 15 seats. However, the 93 seats allotted to 
the princely states were not filled as they decided to stay away from the Constituent Assembly. Hence

Grey hydrogen is the most common form of hydrogen and is generated from natural gas, or methane, 
through a process called “steam reforming”. In this process, natural gas containing methane (CH4) can 
be used to produce hydrogen with thermal processes, such as steam-methane reformation and partial 
oxidation. Hence, statement 1 is correct. 
• 
Hydrogen can be produced from a range of resources including fossil fuels, nuclear energy, biomass, and 
renewable energy sources. Depending on production methods, hydrogen can be grey, blue, or green and 
sometimes even pink, yellow or turquoise. They’re essentially color codes, used within the energy 
industry to differentiate between the types of hydrogen. Depending on the type of production used, 
different colors are assigned to the hydrogen.

Hydrogen emits only water when burnt. It derives the grey hydrogen name because of the process of 
production and not on basis of the by products after burning. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.

o 
They are like an ‘Instrument of Instructions’ or general recommendations addressed to all 
authorities in the Indian Union. They remind them of the basic principles of the new social and 
economic order, which the Constitution aims at building. 
o 
They have served as useful beacon lights to the courts. They have helped the courts in exercising their 
power of judicial review, that is, the power to determine the constitutional validity of a law. 
o 
They form the dominating background to all State action, legislative or executive, and also a guide to 
the courts in some respects. 
o 
They amplify the Preamble, which solemnly resolves to secure to all citizens of India justice, liberty, 
equality, and fraternity.

The Directives also play the following roles: 
o 
They facilitate stability and continuity in domestic and foreign policies in political, economic, 
and social spheres in spite of the changes in the party in power. 
o 
They are supplementary to the fundamental rights of the citizens. They are intended to fill in the 
vacuum in Part III by providing for social and economic rights. 
o 
Their implementation creates a favourable atmosphere for the full and proper enjoyment of the 
fundamental rights by the citizens. Political democracy, without economic democracy, has no 
meaning.

They enable the opposition to exercise influence and control over the operations of the government. 
The Opposition can blame the ruling party on the ground that its activities are opposed to the
