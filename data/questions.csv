"Q7. A deadly stampede in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras resulted in over 120 fatalities during a congregation led by Baba Narayan Hari, also known as ‘Bhole Baba.’ Formerly a government official, Baba Narayan Hari transitioned into a religious preacher two decades ago and has since garnered a significant following in the state. The tragic incident occurred as people were leaving a ‘satsang'(prayer meeting), leading to suffocation and a pile-up of bodies, marking one of the most severe tragedies of its kind in recent years. Thousands attended the ‘satsang’ (prayer meeting), which was privately organized and had received permission from the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM). This incident is part of a tragic pattern of stampedes at religious gatherings in India, which have claimed numerous lives over the years. Notable incidents include the 2005 stampede at Maharashtra’s Mandhardevi temple that resulted in over 340 deaths, the 2008 tragedy at Rajasthan’s Chamunda Devi temple with at least 250 fatalities, and another 2008 stampede at the Naina Devi temple in Himachal Pradesh, which killed 162 people.  [20M]",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2024/12/13/a-deadly-stampede-in-uttar-pradeshs-hathras-resulted-in-over-120-fatalities-during-a-congregation-led-by-baba-narayan-hari-also-known-as-bhole-baba-formerly-a-government-official-baba-narayan/

"Q7. As the Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs, you recently endorsed a visionary project aimed at enhancing national security and fostering development in the Indian Ocean region. The Great Nicobar Island Development Project, a Rs 72,000-crore initiative led by the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Integrated Development Corporation (ANIIDCO), involves extensive infrastructure upgrades on Great Nicobar Island. Spanning 16,610 hectares, the project aims to capitalize on the island’s strategic location near the Malacca Strait and includes the development of an International Container Trans-shipment Terminal (ICTT), a Greenfield international airport, two Greenfield cities, and more. Despite the project’s ethical and rational intentions, it has sparked significant backlash. Media and NGOs argue that the development will devastate pristine forests on the island, home to critical and endangered species such as the giant leatherback turtle. Opposition leaders contend that the project will exploit the coastal eco-sensitive zone and lead to the large-scale displacement of indigenous tribal communities. As a conscientious and visionary officer, you approved the project to enhance national security and promote development. However, the widespread negative feedback raises ethical concerns about environmental sustainability and social justice.  [20 M]",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2024/12/06/as-the-secretary-of-the-ministry-of-home-affairs-you-recently-endorsed-a-visionary-project-aimed-at-enhancing-national-security-and-fostering-development-in-the-indian-ocean-region/

"Q7. As the District Commissioner of Lonavala, you oversee a region that attracts numerous tourists each monsoon season, drawn by its pristine forests and breath taking natural scenery. Recently, a particular waterfall in your district has gained significant popularity due to social media influence. Tragically, on one fateful day, a family of seven from another state visited this waterfall. While they were enjoying their time, the water level suddenly rose due to heavy rainfall in the upstream mountains over the past few days, resulting in five members of the family being swept away by the surge. A police initial report revealed that the location of the incident is a “restricted area” under the jurisdiction of Indian Railways and the Forest Department. However, the media quickly highlighted several administrative lapses too at the tourist site, including the absence of warning signboards, lack of security personnel, and the unavailability of first aid kits and other medical necessities. As public concern grew, the responsibility for addressing these issues fell squarely on your shoulders.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2024/11/22/as-the-district-commissioner-of-lonavala-you-oversee-a-region-that-attracts-numerous-tourists-each-monsoon-season-drawn-by-its-pristine-forests-and-breath-taking-natural-scenery/

"Q7. As Chief Secretary of State, you are facing mounting pressure from the government, media, and public to take responsibility for the tragic incident that unfolded due to a massive fire at an indoor game zone in prominent city. This devastating fire resulted in the loss of 28 lives, including children, and left nine others injured. The game zone, operating under a tin shed with air-conditioners installed, was found to be lacking a fire NOC. Initial investigations by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the government have revealed glaring lapses in safety protocols. Among the findings, it has come to light that the game zone did not have proper emergency exits, which exacerbated the chaos during the fire. Additionally, there were serious violations such as exceeding the permitted storage limit of fuel for go-karting vehicles, posing further risks in case of a fire outbreak. Shockingly, despite these violations being known, the firm game zone continued to operate unchecked for three years. The report from the SIT has also pointed out the inaction of both the Town Planning Department and the Fire Department in addressing these illegalities and enforcing necessary safety measures. As the final report reached your office few of the ministers asked you not to make the report public as it would tarnish the executive system’s name in public. This has led you to the dilemma.

"Q10. You are Raghav, the Municipal Commissioner of a rapidly growing urban city in India. Over the past few years, the city has seen an influx of development projects, including infrastructure, housing, and commercial complexes. While the expansion has significantly boosted the city’s economy, it has also led to numerous legal challenges related to land acquisition, environmental clearances, and unauthorized constructions. Recently, you received a report from the local legal team highlighting several violations of urban planning laws and building codes in the construction of a new high-rise complex in a prime location of the city. The complex, financed by a well-known real estate developer, has already completed 70% of its construction. However, it is discovered that environmental clearance was bypassed, and several building safety regulations were overlooked. The developer, having strong political and business connections, approaches you with an offer of substantial monetary gain to allow the project to continue without delay. Simultaneously, the local community raises concerns about the safety of the building and its impact on the environment. The media has also begun to investigate the project, putting pressure on the administration. As the Municipal Commissioner, your responsibility is to uphold the rule of law and ensure that all projects comply with legal and environmental regulations.

"Q10. As a police inspector in a town renowned for its peace and religious harmony, you receive a report about a robbery that took place at Arun’s Fair Price Shop. Upon arriving at the scene and conducting an initial inquiry, you learn that Arun has accused two individuals, Adil and Pasha, of attempting to rob his shop in the afternoon. According to Arun, when he confronted them, they not only tried to steal from the shop but also attempted to physically assault his child, who was present at the scene. Arun’s quick actions to alert the local community led to a crowd gathering, which prompted Adil and Pasha to flee. Initially, you assumed this was a straightforward robbery case. However, later in the evening, Adil and Pasha voluntarily presented themselves at the police station. During their statements, they revealed that the root of the conflict was not merely theft but rather a dispute over the distribution of food. They alleged that Arun had been systematically discriminating against certain individuals based on their religion in the food distribution process. Their attempt to address this issue with Arun had apparently escalated into a physical altercation. After conducting a thorough and detailed investigation, you find that both Arun and Adil’s accounts of the incident hold validity. Arun’s complaint about the robbery and physical assault, as well as Adil and Pasha’s allegations of religious discrimination, are both substantiated by evidence and testimonies.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2024/08/24/as-a-police-inspector-in-a-town-renowned-for-its-peace-and-religious-harmony-you-receive-a-report-about-a-robbery-that-took-place-at-aruns-fair-price-shop/

Despite the financial hardships, Krithi was a determined and hopeful individual, working diligently at a private company in Bangalore to secure a better future for her family. Krithi’s aspirations included securing a stable job and eventually getting married. She had recently started preparations for her marriage, having engaged in discussions with a prospective groom and his family. Her family was filled with hope and excitement for this new chapter in her life. Living in a paying guest (PG) facility in, Bangalore, Krithi was managing her responsibilities with resilience. The PG facility provided her with the necessary accommodation as she worked far from her hometown. Her presence in Bangalore was a symbol of hope for her family, who depended on her remittances to meet basic needs and sustain their modest lifestyle. On a fateful night, Krithi’s life was abruptly and violently cut short. The attacker, armed with a knife, entered the PG facility and committed a heinous crime. The attack was brutal, Krithi was stabbed multiple times and had her throat slit, horrifically ending her life. This occurred around 11:00 pm after Krithi had returned from her workplace.

While carrying out the surprise inspection by the inspecting team, a minor crack was noticed in one of the piers of the elevated corridor possibly due to poor material used. You immediately informed the chief engineer and stopped further work. It was assessed by you that a minimum of three piers of the elevated corridor have to be demolished and reconstructed. But this process will delay the project minimum by four to six months. But the chief engineer overruled the observation of the inspecting team on the ground that it was a minor crack that will not in any way impact the strength and durability of the bridge. He ordered you to overlook the observation of the inspecting team and continue working with the same speed and tempo. He informed you that the minister does not want any delay as he wants the Chief Minister to inaugurate the elevated corridor before the elections are declared. Also informed you that the contractor is a far relative of the minister and he wants him to finish the project. He also gave you a hint that your further promotion as an additional chief engineer is under consideration by the ministry.

"7. You have just been appointed as Additional Director General of Central Public Works Department. The Chief Architect of your division, who is to retire in six months, is passionately working on a very important project, the successful completion of which would earn him a lasting reputation for the rest of his life. A new lady architect. Seema, trained at Manchester School of Architecture, UK joined as Senior Architect in your division. During the briefing about the project, Seema made some suggestions which would not only add value to the project, but would also reduce completion time. This has made the Chief Architect insecure and he is constantly worried that all the credit will go to her. Subsequently, he adopted a passive and aggressive behaviour towards her and has become disrespectful to her. Seema felt it embarrassing as the Chief Architect left no chance of humiliating her. He would very often correct her in front of other colleagues and raise his voice while speaking to her. This continuous harassment has resulted in her losing confidence and self-esteem. She felt perpetually tense, anxious and stressed. She appeared to be in awe of him since he has had a long tenure in the office and has vast experience in the area of her work. You are aware of her outstanding academic credentials and career record in her previous organisations.

You first warned the troublemakers to mend their ways or else face disciplinary action. When the warning had little effect, you issued a show cause notice to the ringleaders.

"7. You are a young civil servant who has been posted as District Commissioner (DC) for the last 2 years. You have worked hard for the development and upliftment of the poor in rural areas. One day, as you are reading the local newspaper you find a mention of the possible corruption in the legal process to convert agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. The column mentions the local political leaders who may have colluded to convert prime agricultural lands without the necessary approval. It’s an article published in the “citizens voice section” which is mostly citizens presenting their opinions and apprehensions. Many such article columns are published every week without necessary proof or evidence. The newspaper usually resorts to such tactics to publish unverified claims. You neglect the issue, but it keeps intriguing you as such a conversion wouldn’t be possible without the approval of the district commissioner. As an honest and upright officer, you don’t recognize any such misdoings. You start an inquiry of your own on the matter and you have found out that your sign has been forged for a document and the conversion is made. The people responsible for the scam have taken a high-definition JPEG image of your signature and have used it on a morphed document. Surprisingly, this document has found its way to the land records of the district, which had granted legitimacy to such documents. You suspect that this is an insider’s job. Further, you have found that the person mainly responsible for this is your own brother. Last year he colluded with local politicians and has done the illegal conversion of a small parcel of land. Your brother has recently lost his wife to covid and the atmosphere at your home is dull and depressing. Despite this, you confront your brother about the issue; he deeply regrets his actions and asks you not to proceed with any official or legal action which shall be punished with imprisonment of jail term which may extend to two years or with the penalty, or with both. You realize that he has done it due to the negative influence of the local politicians who have now offered to proceed with the conversion legally. As the case is for a small parcel of land, you can easily use your position of power to forgive the offenders and settle the issue without anyone knowing about issue. There is a possibility of more such corruption done by the politicians. At the same time, settling this issue peacefully is important for your family’s mental well-being as your parents would be devastated if their younger son is arrested.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/07/14/7-you-are-a-young-civil-servant-who-has-been-posted-as-district-commissioner-dc-for-the-last-2-years-you-have-worked-hard-for-the-development-and-upliftment-of-the-poor-in-rural-areas-one-da/

"7. Once upon a time in a small, close-knit community nestled in the heart of a bustling city, there lived a visionary named Mr. A. Born into a minority community, Mr. A had always been a passionate advocate for change and progress.

However, little did he know that his ideas would be met with resistance from an unexpected source – his own community.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/23/once-upon-a-time-in-a-small-close-knit-community-nestled-in-the-heart-of-a-bustling-city-there-lived-a-visionary-named-mr-a-born-into-a-minority-community-mr-a-had-always-been-a-passionate-advoc/
"Mr. A was a reformer who challenged the age-old superstitions and conservative beliefs that held his community back.

"However, as Mr. A began to voice his progressive ideas, he faced a strong backlash from within his community.

Superstitions, deeply ingrained over generations, clouded their judgment and prevented them from recognizing the potential benefits of progress.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/06/23/once-upon-a-time-in-a-small-close-knit-community-nestled-in-the-heart-of-a-bustling-city-there-lived-a-visionary-named-mr-a-born-into-a-minority-community-mr-a-had-always-been-a-passionate-advoc/
"Mr. A’s pleas for education, especially for girls, were met with skepticism. The community elders believed that education for girls would lead to immodesty and the erosion of their cultural values.

"Undeterred by the resistance, Mr. A embarked on a journey to educate the youth about the importance of modern education.

"Yet, the road to change was filled with obstacles. Traditionalists spread rumors, portraying Mr. A as a threat to their way of life.

"Similar to Jallikattu, bullfighting has faced increasing scrutiny from animal rights activists due to concerns about animal welfare.

"On the other hand, there are those who argue that bullfighting is an important cultural tradition and a form of art.

"7. Consider the following write-up titled “Polarisation of Social Media”: 1.49 billion people on average log onto Facebook daily; around 6,000 tweets are tweeted on Twitter every second. We become creators of data and information; our experiences in social media are dictated by algorithms. Social media drifted from its promise of exposing use to diverse opinions and expressions from miles beyond our location. Instead, we find ourselves to be more rigid versions of our former selves. In 1950 Asch Conformity Experiments found that an individual was willing to go to the extent of giving a wrong answer just to conform to the majority view. The respondents gave wrong answers either because they did not want to be ridiculed or because they believed that the group was better informed than them. This continues even today and especially in case of fake news online, which is said to contribute to a polarised society. In social media people get information only from people they trust and look for news that confirms their worldview. This results in people cultivating rigid opinions of issues that they would have probably been more willing to discuss in the past. Social media sites are responsible for encouraging this behaviour. Twitter, for example, will routinely prompt you to follow people who hold a viewpoint that is similar to yours. This just strengthens our biases. A study this year on increasing social media polarisation found that algorithmic filtering has created this cycle of enforcing and reinforcing belief systems and ensuring that we don’t open our minds to diverse opinions. While the democratisation of discourse that social media has brought about is undeniable and most welcome, we are getting trapped in narrower world views that are seeping into not only voter behaviour but everyday personal interactions. This is something we must be alarmed about.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2023/05/05/consider-the-following-write-up-titled-polarisation-of-social-media-1-49-billion-people-on-average-log-onto-facebook-daily-around-6000-tweets-are-tweeted-on-twitter-every-second/

"7. You are a young civil servant who has been posted as District Commissioner (DC) for the last 2 years. You have worked hard for the development and upliftment of the poor in rural areas. One day, as you are reading the local newspaper you find a mention of the possible corruption in the legal process to convert agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. The column mentions the local political leaders who may have colluded to convert prime agricultural lands without the necessary approval. It’s an article published in the “citizens voice section” which is mostly citizens presenting their opinions and apprehensions. Many such article columns are published every week without necessary proof or evidence. The newspaper usually resorts to such tactics to publish unverified claims. You neglect the issue, but it keeps intriguing you as such a conversion wouldn’t be possible without the approval of the district commissioner. As an honest and upright officer, you don’t recognize any such misdoings. You start an inquiry of your own on the matter and you have found out that your sign has been forged for a document and the conversion is made. The people responsible for the scam have taken a high-definition JPEG image of your signature and have used it on a morphed document. Surprisingly, this document has found its way to the land records of the district, which had granted legitimacy to such documents. You suspect that this is an insider’s job. Further, you have found that the person mainly responsible for this is your own brother. Last year he colluded with local politicians and has done the illegal conversion of a small parcel of land. Your brother has recently lost his wife to covid and the atmosphere at your home is dull and depressing. Despite this, you confront your brother about the issue; he deeply regrets his actions and asks you not to proceed with any official or legal action which shall be punished with imprisonment of jail term which may extend to two years or with the penalty, or with both. You realize that he has done it due to the negative influence of the local politicians who have now offered to proceed with the conversion legally. As the case is for a small parcel of land, you can easily use your position of power to forgive the offenders and settle the issue without anyone knowing about issue. There is a possibility of more such corruption done by the politicians. At the same time, settling this issue peacefully is important for your family’s mental well-being as your parents would be devastated if their younger son is arrested.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/11/11/you-are-a-young-civil-servant-who-has-been-posted-as-district-commissioner-dc-for-the-last-2-years-you-have-worked-hard-for-the-development-and-upliftment-of-the-poor-in-rural-areas-one-day-as-yo/

"7. Pawan is working as an officer in the State Government for the last ten years. As a part of routine transfer, he was posted to another department. He joined in a new office along with five other colleagues. The head of the office was a senior officer conversant with the functioning of the office. As a part of general inquiry, Pawan gathered that his senior officer carries the reputation of being difficult and insensitive person having his own disturbed family life. Initially, all seem to go well. However, after some time Pawan felt that the senior officer was belittling him and at times unreasonable. Whatever suggestions given or views expressed by Pawan in the meetings were summarily rejected and the senior officer would express displeasure in the presence of others. It became a pattern of boss’s style of functioning to show him in bad light highlighting his shortcomings and humiliating publically. It became apparent that though there are no serious work-related problems/shortcomings, the senior officer was always on one pretext or the other and would scold and shout at him. The continuous harassment and public criticism of Pawan resulted in loss of confidence, self-esteem and equanimity. Pawan realized that his relations with his senior officer are becoming more toxic and due to this, he felt perpetually tensed, anxious and stressed. His mind was occupied with negativity and caused him mental torture, anguish and agony. Eventually, it badly affected his personal and family life. He was no longer joyous, happy and contented even t home. Rather without any reason he would loose his temper with his wife and other family members. The family environment was no longer pleasant and congenial. His wife who was always supportive to him also became a victim of his negativity and hostile behaviour. Due to harassment and humiliation suffering by him in the office, comfort and happiness virtually vanished from his life.

"7. You are a no-nonsense, honest officer. You have been transferred to a remote district to head a department that is notorious for its inefficiency and callousness. You find that the main cause of the poor state of affairs is the indiscipline of a section of employees. They do not work themselves and also disrupt the workings of others. You first warned the troublemakers to mend their ways or else face disciplinary action. When the warning had little effect, you issued a show cause notice to the ringleaders. As a retaliatory measure, these troublemakers instigated a woman employee amongst them to file a complaint of sexual harassment against you with the Women’s Commission. The Commission promptly seeks your explanation. The matter is also publicized in the media to embarrass you further. Some of the options to handle this situation could be as follows: (i) Give your explanation to the Commission and go soft on the disciplinary action. (ii) Ignore the commission and proceed firmly with the disciplinary action. (iii) Brief your higher-ups, seek directions from them and act accordingly. Suggest any other possible option(s). Evaluate all of them and suggest the best course of action, giving your reasons for it.

"7. An elevated corridor is being constructed to reduce traffic congestion in the capital of a particular state. You have been selected as project manager of this prestigious project on your professional competence and experience. The deadline is to complete the project in the next two years by 30 June 2021, since the project is to be inaugurated by the Chief Minister before the elections are announced in the second week of July 2021. While carrying out the surprise inspection by the inspecting team, a minor crack was noticed in one of the piers of the elevated corridor possibly due to poor material used. You immediately informed the chief engineer and stopped further work. It was assessed by you that a minimum of three piers of the elevated corridor have to be demolished and reconstructed. But this process will delay the project minimum by four to six months. But the chief engineer overruled the observation of the inspecting team on the ground that it was a minor crack that will not in any way impact the strength and durability of the bridge. He ordered you to overlook the observation of the inspecting team and continue working with the same speed and tempo. He informed you that the minister does not want any delay as he wants the Chief Minister to inaugurate the elevated corridor before the elections are declared. Also informed you that the contractor is a far relative of the minister and he wants him to finish the project. He also gave you a hint that your further promotion as an additional chief engineer is under consideration by the ministry. However, you strongly felt that the minor crack in the pier in the elevated corridor will adversely affect the health and life of the bridge and therefore it will be very dangerous not to repair the elevated corridor.  (250 words) (UPSC 2021)",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2022/07/01/an-elevated-corridor-is-being-constructed-to-reduce-traffic-congestion-in-the-capital-of-a-particular-state-you-have-been-selected-as-project-manager-of-this-prestigious-project-on-your-professional-2/

"One day, an old couple visited Rakesh’s office with their application. They have been the residents of a village in his district since their birth. The old man is diagnosed with a rare condition that causes obstruction in the large intestine.

"6. An elevated corridor is being constructed to reduce traffic congestion in the capital of a particular state. You have been selected as project manager of this prestigious project on your professional competence and experience. The deadline is to complete the project in the next two years by 30 June 2021, since the project is to be inaugurated by the Chief Minister before the elections are announced in the second week of July 2021. While carrying out the surprise inspection by the inspecting team, a minor crack was noticed in one of the piers of the elevated corridor possibly due to poor material used. You immediately informed the chief engineer and stopped further work. It was assessed by you that a minimum of three piers of the elevated corridor have to be demolished and reconstructed. But this process will delay the project minimum by four to six months. But the chief engineer overruled the observation of the inspecting team on the ground that it was a minor crack that will not in any way impact the strength and durability of the bridge. He ordered you to overlook the observation of the inspecting team and continue working with the same speed and tempo. He informed you that the minister does not want any delay as he wants the Chief Minister to inaugurate the elevated corridor before the elections are declared. Also informed you that the contractor is a far relative of the minister and he wants him to finish the project. He also gave you a hint that your further promotion as an additional chief engineer is under consideration by the ministry. However, you strongly felt that the minor crack in the pier in the elevated corridor will adversely affect the health and life of the bridge and therefore it will be very dangerous not to repair the elevated corridor.

"7. Jallikattu has been known to be practiced during the Tamil classical period (400-100 BCE). It was common among the Ayar people who lived in the ‘Mullai’ geographical division of the ancient Tamizh Nadu. Yet despite its cultural significance, Jallikattu continues to face increasing scrutiny in light of animal rights issues.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/03/jallikattu-has-been-known-to-be-practiced-during-the-tamil-classical-period-400-100-bce-it-was-common-among-the-ayar-people-who-lived-in-the-mullai-geographical-division-of-the-an/
"Some people consider Jallikattu a cruel sport. Many animal rights activists often protest Jallikattu, citing the needless endangerment of the bull and bullfighter. As there were incidents of injury and death associated with the sport, both to the participants and to the animals forced into it, animal rights organizations have called for a ban to the sport, resulting in the court banning it several times over the past years. However, with protest from the people against the ban, a new ordinance was made in 2017 to continue the sport",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/03/jallikattu-has-been-known-to-be-practiced-during-the-tamil-classical-period-400-100-bce-it-was-common-among-the-ayar-people-who-lived-in-the-mullai-geographical-division-of-the-an/
"Some cities around the world where Jallikattu type bullfighting was once popular, including Coslada (Spain), Mouans-Sartoux (France), and Teocelo (Mexico), have even declared themselves to be anti-bullfighting cities. Other places, including some towns in Catalonia (Spain), have ceased killing the bull in the fight, but continue bullfighting.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/03/jallikattu-has-been-known-to-be-practiced-during-the-tamil-classical-period-400-100-bce-it-was-common-among-the-ayar-people-who-lived-in-the-mullai-geographical-division-of-the-an/
"To other people, the spectacle of the bullfight is not mere sport. The event is not only culturally significant, but also a fine art in which the bullfighter is trained in a certain style and elicits emotion through the act of the fight. Writer Alexander Fiske-Harrison, in his research and training as a bullfighter, defends the practice and circumstances of the bull, “In terms of animal welfare, the fighting bull lives four to six years whereas the meat cow lives one to two. …Those years are spent free roaming…” And others similarly argue that the death of the bull in the ring is more humane than the death of animals in a slaughterhouse.",https://www.insightsonindia.com/2021/09/03/jallikattu-has-been-known-to-be-practiced-during-the-tamil-classical-period-400-100-bce-it-was-common-among-the-ayar-people-who-lived-in-the-mullai-geographical-division-of-the-an/
